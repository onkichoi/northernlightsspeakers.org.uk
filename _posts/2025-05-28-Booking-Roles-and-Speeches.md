To help organise our meetings and manage our club records, we use [**easySPEAK**](https://toastmasterclub.org/portal.php?page=720)—a free online platform used by many Toastmasters clubs.

As a member, you’ll get access to easySPEAK, where you are strongly encouraged to do this for each meeting:

- Indicate your attendance

- Book speech slots or meeting roles

You can also keep track of your past speeches and role history to help you advance along your pathway(s).

Your login details will be set up when you join, and you can update your password the first time you log in.

Getting involved in easySPEAK and club activities is one of the best ways to accelerate your growth as a speaker and leader.

Finally, we also encourage you to explore [www.toastmasters.org—Toastmasters’ official site](http://www.toastmasters.org/)—for a wealth of educational resources and more about the global organisation, founded in 1924.
